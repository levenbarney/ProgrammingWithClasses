/*
Scenario
You have been hired to help a company with their product ordering system. They sell many products 
online to a variety of customers and need to produce packing labels, shipping labels, and compute 
final prices for billing.
Program Specification
Write a program that has classes for Product, Customer, Address, and Order. The responsibilities of 
these classes are as follows:
Order
- Contains a list of products and a customer. Can calculate the total cost of the order, and can return 
a string for the packing label, and can return a string for the shipping label.
- The total price is calculated as the sum of the prices of each product plus a one-time shipping cost.
- This company is based in the USA. If the customer lives in the USA, then the shipping cost is $5. 
- If the customer does not live in the USA, then the shipping cost is $35.
- A packing label should list the name and product id of each product in the order.
- A shipping label should list the name and address of the customer.
Product
- Contains the name, product id, price, and quantity of each product.
- The price of this product is computed by multiplying the price and the quantity.
Customer
- The customer contains a name and an address.
- The name is a string, but the Address is a class.
- The customer should have a method that can return whether they live in the USA or not. (Hint this 
should call a method on the address to find this.)
Address
- The address contains a string for the street address, the city, state/province, and country.
- The address should have a method that can return whether it is in the USA or not.
- The address should have a method to return a string all of its fields together in one string (with 
newline characters where appropriate)
Other considerations
- Make sure that all member variables are private and getters, setters, and constructors are created as 
needed.
Once you have created these classes, write a program that creates at least two orders with 2-3 
products each. Call the methods to get the packing label, the shipping label, and the total price of 
the order, and display the results of these methods.
